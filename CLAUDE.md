# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project

A Minecraft plugin/server project targeting **Folia + Paper compatibility**.

## Requirements

- Java 21
- Maven (build tool)
- Must remain compatible with both Folia and Paper (avoid APIs that break under Folia's regionized threading model — e.g. no global `BukkitScheduler` assumptions; use the scheduler abstraction below)

## Dependencies

- InvUI — inventory GUIs
- CommandAPI — command registration/handling
- UniversalScheduler — Folia/Paper-safe task scheduling (always use this instead of raw Bukkit scheduler calls)
- Lombok — reduce boilerplate (getters/setters/builders/etc.)
- Adventure text-minimessage — all user-facing text/formatting should use MiniMessage via Adventure, not legacy `§` color codes

### If a database is needed

- HikariCP — connection pooling
- sqlite-jdbc — SQLite driver

## Architecture

- Strict OOP: favor clear class hierarchies, encapsulation, and single-responsibility classes over procedural/utility-dump style code.
